# PicoJuice
A micropython mostly equivilent version of the MixJuice peripheral for the IchigoJam P using a Raspberry PicoW* .

This is still a work in progress but it mostly works. There are still loads of bugs and idiosyncrasies and missing functionality.

If you are powering the picow using the 5v and gnd pins on the IchigoJam P then you should wait a few seconds after the led on the PicoW lights before turning on the IchigoJam P after you plug a cable into the IchigoJam P's power socket.

*in theory it should work on and device that runs micropython and has wifi capabilities but i've not tested anything other than a PicoW.
